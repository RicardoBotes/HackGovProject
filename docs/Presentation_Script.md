# PathFinder AI — Speaker Script (Full)

**Slide: Title**  
PathFinder AI reduces loneliness by connecting seniors to community activities. It autonomously plans and executes the boring parts — searching, booking, arranging transport, and sending reminders — via channels seniors already use.

**Slide: Problem**  
Isolation is a major risk factor for mental and physical health. Many seniors lack the time, knowledge, or digital skills to navigate complex portals. Councils are stretched thin.

**Slide: Solution**  
PathFinder is an agentic assistant: it reasons over goals and executes tasks end-to-end, with consent and audit logging. It is voice/SMS-first, multilingual, and accessible by design.

**Slide: Architecture**  
Explain each module: intake, planner & tools, policies, catalog & learning. Emphasise consent gates before data sharing or booking.

**Slide: Demo Flow**  
Step through consent → discovery → booking → transport → reminders → aftercare. Mention that the demo runs locally with standard Python only.

**Slide: Privacy & Trust**  
Just-in-time consent, PII minimisation, purpose limitation. Red flags trigger human handoff. Audit logs stored as JSONL for transparency.

**Slide: Metrics**  
We track time-to-engagement, drop-offs, handoff rate, satisfaction, and equity across cohorts. Simulated logs are included to visualise expected distributions.

**Slide: Roadmap**  
Discovery with seniors and carers → MVP on voice/SMS → pilot with 50 residents in 2 suburbs → scale to other councils with shared service catalogs.
